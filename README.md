# N-Queens-Visualizer
A project to demonstrate visualization for N-Queens Problem using backtracking algorithm.

## Overview
This project visualizes the solution to the classic N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization and computer science, where the challenge is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Here, "threaten" means that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Demo
[Live Demo](https://aanyapanigrahi.github.io/N-Queens-Visualizer/) <!-- Replace with live demo link -->

## Features
- **Interactive Board**: Enter the board size (N) and click "Solve" to see the solutions visually.
- **Solution Visualization**: Each solution is displayed on the board as soon as it is found.
- **Visual Feedback**: Queens are represented by chess symbols ('♛') and highlighted cells indicate their positions.

## How it Works
The program uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations of placing queens on the board:
1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Attempts to place queens row by row, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.
2. **Visualization**: Updates the board dynamically to show the current state of the solution process.

## Usage
1. Enter a number between 1 and 10 in the "Board Size" input field.
2. Click "Solve" to see the N-Queens solutions visualized on the board.
3. Solutions are displayed as they are found.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS for front-end structure and styling
- JavaScript for dynamic behavior and algorithm implementation
